# Git Workshop

## Underlying Concepts

### Git
- A version control tool
- Alternatives include SVN and CVS

## GitHub
- A company that acts a host in the cloud
- Alternatives include Bitbucket (Stash) and GitLab

## Commits
- Git is all about commit hashes
- Branch names are just pointers/references to commit hashes
- One commit hash could have multiple branch alias, but every commit must have a unique hash

If there's a task that must be done,
Don't turn your tail and run.
Don't pout, Don't sob,
Just do a half-assed job.

If you cut every corner, it is really not so bad.
Everybody does it, even Mom and Dad.
If nobody sees it, then nobody gets mad. 
It's the American way.

The policeman on the beat
Needs some time to rest his feet.
Fighting crime is not my cup of tea.
And the clerk who runs the store
Can charge a little more
For meat (For meat),
And milk (And milk)
From nineteen eighty-four.

If you cut every corner,
You'll have more time for play.
It's the American way!!

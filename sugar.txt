And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! 
It's very clear to see that

A Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down-wown, the medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way

The honey bee that fetch the nectar
From the flowers to the comb
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip
From every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence),
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind.

Just a spoonful of sugar 
Helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
